## About the book
This book introduces readers to ROS 2 without requiring prior experience in robotics. It blends theoretical explanations with practical exercises, empowering readers to solve specific robotics problems while understanding the reasoning behind various approaches.
The book covers a broad spectrum of robotics topics, including mobile robots, industrial manipulators, and aerial robots. These systems are simulated using the modern Gazebo simulator and programmed with ROS 2’s out-of-the-box tools and custom solutions using the ROS 2 API. The book also delves into computer vision, generative AI, and machine learning, providing hands-on examples of real-world applications.
With intermediate challenges designed to reinforce learning, this book serves as an all-encompassing guide for anyone looking to master robotics programming with ROS 2 and Python. Step into the future of robotics and gain the expertise to build sophisticated, real-world robotic systems that can tackle the complex challenges of tomorrow.

### Who is this book for?
This book is tailored for software developers and engineers looking to dive into robotics programming. It’s perfect for ROS developers seeking to expand their skills and those new to ROS 2, offering in-depth insights into both foundational concepts and advanced techniques in robotics development.

### In the spotlight
This book dives into various challenges in computer science and robotics. Each chapter starts with a theoretical foundation and explores the state-of-the-art solutions, followed by practical implementations and simulations using ROS 2 and Python. Topics include robot navigation, automated code testing, robot manipulation, sensor processing, and machine learning (LLMs and DRL), all presented with a structured approach: What - Why - How.
Highlights:
- Gain a deep understanding of the core structure of ROS 2 nodes using Python.
- Master simulation with Modern Gazebo (as Gazebo Classic is now deprecated), integrating mobile and industrial robots with ROS 2.
- Learn to program complex behaviors using Python behavior trees (PyTrees).
- Solve control problems with classical approaches.
- Tackle robot navigation in unknown environments.
- Control robots using free-to-use Large Language Models.
- Implement robot control strategies with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
- …and much more!
